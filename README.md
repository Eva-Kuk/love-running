- A first responsive website built entirely using HTML and CSS as a  part of Code Institute course walkthrough project . 
It is build a fully responsive website that showcases the features of HTML5 and CSS
that I have build on the course. 
- By building the Love Running website I gained a better understanding of how HTML and CSS interact with and complement each other.
- The project helpen me to begin to develop my design instincts in determining how balanced
layout and structure come together to create good user experiences. 

### The purpose of the website

- The love Running website is an imagined website provided for a local running community.
- The site contains basic information for runners who may wish to drop in for a
run or a social meetup at specific times and locations. 
- The site also provides links to any additional social media presence the running group might have.
- The site is comprised of three pages; Home, Gallery and Signup. While the **Home**
page contains the highest priority information such as the meetup times
and motivational messages, the **Gallery** page reinforces the sense of community
and inclusion by displaying images of the runners on a virtual photo wall. The sign-up form for the benefit of the Love Running community and organisers. The form on the **Sign up** page allows a user to submit their running preferences so the Love Running volunteers can cater for expected numbers of runners on particular days. For
consistency of user experience the site's logo, navigation links and social
media links on the page footer are repeated across the site pages. 
- The Love Running website is a responsive on all devices by using media query. The site elements will rearrange themselves according to the current
browser screen width available to it and the finished site will allow for three
different screen widths to maintain the consistency of design and information
presentation. 

### Bug
